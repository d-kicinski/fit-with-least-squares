Small project made for Modeling and Indetification class. I was given numerical data taken from some SISO(single input single output) object and was asked to create regression model. The main difficulty was to cross-validate the parameters of the model: the degree of non-linearity and degree of dynamic.

Originally it was written in MATLAB but i've rewritten it in Python(numpy + seaborn + pandas + matplotlib) for learning purposes so there's no real raport from experiments bu best model can be find in README.ipynb
